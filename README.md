### Bitquery Editor


With [**Bitquery Editor**](https://graphql.bitquery.io/), we are changing the way how developers work with blockchains data.

Using our Bitquery editor, developers can create GraphQL queries to use them as APIs. You can also share queries with anyone; for example, check this [GraphQL query](https://explorer.bitquery.io/graphql/NPrY9TzCX1) for the top 10 DEX trades based on USD amount.

Developers will able to save their queries and share them with team members or publicly. And use them directly in their applications as APIs. In addition, we are building ‘Flexigraph,’ which will allow developers to expand our schema by joining multiple queries and other techniques.

We also plan to enable visualization through drag and drop charts building using the query results, helping analysts and data scientists visualizing blockchain data.

Our editor and queries will be powered by Bitquery Infra, where we currently process more than 160 TB of blockchain data.

Bitquery editor is [open-source](https://github.com/bitquery/graphql-ide), and we plan to make it a universal GUI tool for working with blockchain data for developers, analysts, and data scientists.
